## Homework problems for Day 1 of the Remedial Revision

### Problem 1
Write a program to take two integers a and b as input from the user and print the following expression:
((a + b) / (a - b)) x ((a - b) / (a + b))

Try out different inputs and see if you get a "Divide by zero" error anywhere.


### Problem 2
Write a program to calculate the remainder of a number n divided by (n-1). Take the number n as input from the user and print the remainder when it is divided by (n-1)


### Problem 3
When x = 10, y = 20 and z = 30, what is the value of the following conditions

1. (x > y)
2. ((x - z) >= (y - z))
3. (((x + z) * (y + z)) >= 100)
4. (x < y) and not(y > z)
5. (x == (y-10)) or (x != (z-20))
6. not( ((x-y) < 10) and ((x + y) > z) )
7. not((x > y) or not(x > z))


### Problem 4
Take the age of a person in years as input. Print whether or not the person is a senior citizen (i.e. older than or equal to 65 years).


### Problem 5
Take the age of a person in years as input, and print one of the following:
if the age is greater than or equal to 90, print "nonagenarian"
if the age is greater than or equal to 80, print "octagenarian"
if the age is greater than or equal to 70, print "septagenarian"
if the age is greater than or equal to 60, print "hexagenarian"
if the age is greater than or equal to 40, print "middle aged"
